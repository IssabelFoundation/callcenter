Custom panel support for Agent Console
--------------------------------------

In order to add customizations to the Agent Console, it might be useful to add
additional panels as tabs with new controls. The following document is a model
to set an API standard for custom panels, in order to minimize changes to the
core files of the Agent Console.

File organization
-----------------

To add a new panel, a new directory must be created under panels/ , with the
files making up the panel. The directory must contain a file called index.php
that defines the entry points for the required functionality. Additionally the
following directorys should be included, if necessary:

js/
Javascript functions to be included for the panel implementation. Every file
under this directory will be included as a <script> tag reference.

lang/
Language translations for the texts to use in the panel. The translation file
format is identical to the files used by the standard modules.

tpl/
Files with templates for the panel.

Other directories or files are ignored by the code, although they might be
explicitly included.

Functions and classes to implement
----------------------------------

In order to prevent name collisions between panels, the panel-supplied index.php
must define a class with a name that is derived from the panel directory name,
with the first letter in uppercase. For example, a directory called "awesome"
should define a class called "Panel_Awesome".

The class may define the following functions:

static function templateContent($module_name, $smarty, $local_templates_dir, $oPaloConsola, $estado)

If defined, the templateContent function should return the texts for the panel
title and content. The class must be defined in order for a panel to be shown
at all in the console. The title text is inserted inside <a> tags that reference
an anchor called "#tabs-PANELNAME" where PANELNAME is the directory name for the
panel files. The content string is the HTML content to place inside the panel
<div> tag. This tag, in turn, has an "id" attribute with its value set to
"tabs-PANELNAME". The content strings must be returned as follows:

array('title' => "...", 'content' => "...")

The $smarty parameter is the Smarty object instance used for the templates, and
it can be used to generate the HTML content. The $local_templates_dir is the
path to the tpl directory, and it can be directly used in a Smarty invocation,
such as the following:

$content = $smarty->fetch("$local_templates_dir/test.tpl");


static function handleJSON_ACTION($module_name, $smarty, $local_templates_dir, $oPaloConsola, $estado)

For each action defined by the panel that requires server access, a function can
be defined called "handleJSON_ACTION", where ACTION is used to choose the desired
operation. The HTTP request that invokes this action must specify a GET or POST
parameter called "action", with a value of "panelname_Action" The "panelname"
string identifies the panel to use and will use the class named Panel_Panelname.
The "ACTION" string is used to build the functionname handleJSON_ACTION. Despite
what the prefix suggests, the function may return any required string content,
in any format that can be generated. The function is responsible to call the
Header() function to set Content-Type as necessary to match the intented output
format. According to the Elastix framework standard, the request must also include
"rawmode=yes" as a parameter to switch off the output of the Elastix HTML menus.
